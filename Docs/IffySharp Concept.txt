-----------

Interactive Fiction platform in C#.  Eventually maybe we'll have a compiler generates C# targeting the library.


GOALS

+	Sandbox experience with powerful simulation.
+	Accept (more) complicated expressive sentences from user.
+	Mad-Libs style user content creation: if you build something in game you get to help describe it!

3D SIMULATION

+	World divided into blocks.  Vertically run-line compressed.
+	Each block ~2m cubed.
+	3 x 3 x 3 area considered "reachable" (including air and ground)
+	Properties of blocks expressed as value causes.
+	Properties of blocks stored in dictionaries
+	Most blocks "asleep" and have no dependencies on antyhing.
+	Before a block is first modified it's neighbors are "woken up" by adding its dependencies to
	neighboring blocks.
	(Note: this is just a trick to make runline compression work.)

+	Step = move one block
+	Walk = move three blocks

+	Simulation works by updating state of objects.
+	Controls and properties are implemented as Causes.
+	Major objects include: Time, Weather, Light, Sound, Map, Player, Block
+	Maps made of blocks, blocks bundle Weather, Light, and Sound with them.
+	Games manipulate the simulation by invoking Causes on accessible objects.
+	The "Renderer" composes descriptions by fetching templatized strings
	from Causes in relevant objects.


ROOM DESCRIPTION ENGINE

+	Templatized descriptions for each block.  Many nearby blocks use the same description.
+	Optional description of objects in 3x3x3 region.
+	Optional description of nearby regions


MAD-LIBS ENGINE


STATE PERSISTENCE

+	Serializable IF instance.
